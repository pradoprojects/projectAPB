I and two undergrad students working under my supervision planned, proposed and carried out this project. The project aimed at Brazilian high-school-level students who wished to learn code. The project focused on developing their algorithmic thinking - rather than just learning a programming language in the traditional way.
</p>
  
<p>
The project encompassed playful activities such as handcrafting bracelets with the student's initials in binary ASCII representation, cardboard games, problem-solving challenges, team challenges mixed with programming -- and even the coding of a time-capsule, where the students hard-coded messages with their forecasts to the next ten years.
</p>
  
 
<p>
The project also stimulated the application and participation of women and the LGBTQIA+ audience to promote their inclusion and empowerment in the Brazilian tech field.
